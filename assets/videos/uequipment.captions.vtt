00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:09.466
Understanding the Concepts

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.233
Heat Absorption Principles

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:14.266
Heat is the molecular movement

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.099
of molecules in a substance.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.133
The faster the molecules move,

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.233
the higher the temperature of a substance.

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.332
The amount of heat is measured in British thermal

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.133
units, or Btu’s.

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.766
A Btu is the amount of heat needed to raise the

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.932
temperature of one pound of water

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.299
by one degree Fahrenheit.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.600
There are also two types of heat

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.933
sensible and latent.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.500
Sensible heat is heat that causes a change

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.566
in the temperature of a substance but does

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.766
not change the state of the substance.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.000
Latent heat is the amount of heat required

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.466
to cause a change of state of a substance

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.032
without changing its temperature.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.933
A Btu content chart is used to understand the

00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.733
amount of Btu’s it takes to change ice to

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.699
water, then to steam.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.966
Looking at the #1 on the chart, we can

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:09.066
see that the ice is at 0 °F and has not absorbed

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.932
any heat Btu.

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.666
When the ice warms

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.199
to 32 °F, point 2, on the chart

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.733
it has not begun to melt; the ice absorbed 16 Btu’s

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.733
of sensible heat.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
Going from point 2 to point 3 on the chart,

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:27.099
the ice melts.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.966
Notice the temperature did not go up,

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:33.199
but the ice absorbed latent heat to change the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.033
state of ice to liquid water.

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.099
Going from point 3 to 4, the water is absorbing

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.533
sensible heat and increasing its temperature to

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.666
212 °F.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.233
The water absorbs 180 Btu’s to change the

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.633
temperature 180 °F.

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:54.799
From point 4 to 5, the water is boiling off

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.633
to a vapor.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.700
The temperature of the water does not exceed

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.166
212° F, but it does absorb 970 Btu’s of latent heat

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.399
while changing state.

00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:09.566
The Btu chart shows that when a substance is

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:10.099
boiling,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.066
it is absorbing latent heat that yields the greatest

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.299
heat exchange.

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:17.699
Latent heat transfer takes place in the two heat

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.700
exchangers of the AC system,

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:21.999
the evaporator and the condenser.

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:25.566
The job of the evaporator is to absorb heat from

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.166
the air passing over it.

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:30.066
It does this by boiling the refrigerant and

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.732
absorbing the latent heat as well as the sensible

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:33.633
heat from the air.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.566
By adjusting the pressure of the refrigerant,

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:38.899
we can adjust the boiling temperature as well.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.066
For a substance to boil,

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.499
it has to overcome the pressure

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500
pushing down on it.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.000
Therefore, lowering the pressure will reduce the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.066
boiling temperature.

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:50.766
Looking at a pressure temperature chart

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:55.166
for R134a, we can see that when the refrigerant

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.899
shows a pressure of 28 pounds per square inch,

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.199
or psig,

00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:04.366
we know that the refrigerant will boil at 32 °F.

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:06.999
Heat travels from a substance at

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.866
a higher temperature to a substance at

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:11.232
a lower temperature, hot to cold.

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:13.433
Lowering the boiling temperature

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:16.066
of the refrigerant in the evaporator allows the

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:18.466
evaporator to operate at a temperature colder

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:20.232
than the air passing over it.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.633
Boiling the refrigerant allows the AC system to

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:25.833
absorb as much heat as possible,

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.866
cooling the air as much as possible.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.132
Through conduction, the cold refrigerant absorbs

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:33.499
the heat from the fins of the evaporator,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.000
cooling the entire coil.

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:38.166
Through convection, the coil and the fins of the

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:40.366
evaporator absorb heat from the air passing

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:41.332
through it.

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:44.166
The refrigerant also relies on the principles

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.833
of convection to carry the heat to the condenser

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:49.033
to reject the heat from the AC system.

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:52.166
Now enter the simulation

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:54.532
for more on the principles of heat absorption.
