00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.433
Welcome to Cengage’s simulation

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:05.599
on Heating and Air Conditioning.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.866
This simulation includes great resources

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.232
such as interactive assignments,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.466
videos, assessments,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.166
and other study tools that can engage students

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.766
and improve outcomes.

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.666
This guided walkthrough will help you

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.566
understand and become familiar with

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.799
the simulation.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.299
When you start your assignment from MindTap,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.933
you will see this screen.

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.632
Using the Simulation plays this video.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.732
Understanding the Concepts

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.066
 is a video that helps you 

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.732
obtain a deeper understanding of the concept 

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.899
being presented in the simulation, 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.700
offering real-life applications,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.166
formulas behind various concepts, 

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.399
safety precautions, etc.

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.866
Enter Simulation will launch the simulation.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.966
After clicking on “Enter Simulation,”

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.133
you will be taken to this screen.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.533
The user interface is created in a way

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.866
that you can access this information

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:10.232
either from your desktop or mobile devices.

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.932
Throughout the interface,

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.899
voice-based guidance assists you

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.566
through the different activities.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.499
Components on the screen can be dragged

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.366
and repositioned using mouse

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.699
or finger gestures on touch-based devices.

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.966
Let’s begin by reviewing the menu bar.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.066
The plus and minus buttons

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.299
help you to zoom in or zoom out

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.433
on a particular part of the screen to see

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:38.766
intricate details.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.400
You can mute or unmute the audio

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.866
by clicking this button.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.233
When an activity starts,

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:51.333
the audio gives you instructions for that activity.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.966
If you need to repeat the instructions,

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.166
you can click this button to replay.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.099
Clicking repeatedly on this button

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100
will step back through the voice guidance

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.600
one block at a time.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.532
By default,

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.899
the closed captions are switched on,

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:11.033
you can click on this button to switch it off.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.766
This button provides you with additional

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:19.199
Service or Supplemental Information.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.799
Work Instructions, wiring diagrams,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.833
and other such information is provided here.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.699
Clicking this button opens a sub-menu.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.833
You can read a brief task description

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:34.566
for the activities by clicking the task menu.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.566
At any point during the simulation,

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:39.266
if you want to see the video

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:41.566
Understanding the Equipment or Concepts,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.200
you can click this button.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.900
The full list of simulation activities

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.966
are listed here.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.033
By default,

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:53.199
the activities progress in sequence,

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:55.566
you can move between activities

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:58.032
by selecting the activity on this menu.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:02.832
An activity can be completed only once.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.166
When you finish an activity,

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:07.066
you will see a check mark next to it.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.933
If you have partially completed an activity,

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:13.833
and you want to exit or move to another activity,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.033
you will lose unsaved work on that activity.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.866
In some simulations,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.199
a tool tray icon is displayed.

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:25.033
Clicking the tool tray will open a window

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:28.166
with tools that will be needed for that activity.

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:32.699
Multiple activities constitute a simulation.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.933
Depending on the simulation,

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:37.433
there may be instructional screens or pop-up

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:39.699
questions to check your understanding.

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:42.666
Clicking on the close button

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.299
reports the scores of the completed activities

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.233
 and quits.

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:51.066
Once you finish working on all the activities,

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.666
you will be taken to the review questions

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.733
to check your learning outcome.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.433
Here is how the simulation

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:00.233
determines your score.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.566
As you complete a task,

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.432
scores are tracked and displayed

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:05.533
here on the screen.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.800
If you perform an activity correctly

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.066
on the first attempt,

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:11.733
you will get 3 points.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:14.532
You get 2 points if you get it right

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:15.699
on the second attempt

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.966
and 1 point if you get it right on the third attempt.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:21.999
After the third incorrect attempt,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.033
the answer is highlighted.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.233
Completing the activity correctly

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.399
after the answer is disclosed

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.266
doesn’t award you any points.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.233
For every correct pop-up

00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:36.066
or review question, you receive 1 point.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.966
When you are done with all the activities

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:41.499
and review questions in the simulation,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.300
your score is displayed.

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:45.733
You can see your detailed performance

00:04:45.733 --> 00:04:46.799
by clicking on the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.966
“View Performance Report” button.

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:51.032
The Performance Report

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.599
provides you the details of your performance

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.366
by showing your total score,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500
percentage,

00:04:56.766 --> 00:04:59.232
time elapsed in completing the simulation,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.266
number of attempts, and more.

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:03.933
You can download your performance report

00:05:03.933 --> 00:05:05.333
for future reference.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200
The performance report

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.333
will also be stored for future review
